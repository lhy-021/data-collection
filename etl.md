# Alteryx Project Showcase
**Alteryx Projects at Macquarie University**

During my tenure at Macquarie University, I played a key role in developing and maintaining a suite of BI projects utilizing various technologies such as Azure SQL Database, Alteryx, and Power BI. These projects catered to a diverse audience including students, staff, and academics within the faculty. The delivered products consisted of a series of Power BI visualization tools, enabling users to interact with timetable, test results, and class information data effectively.
